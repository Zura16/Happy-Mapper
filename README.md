## Where and Why NexaSDK Is Used

NexaSDK is used for on-device AI inference when parsing uploaded deal images.
When a user uploads a photo of a menu or poster, NexaSDK runs a local language and vision model directly on the device. It extracts structured information such as venue name, deal items, prices, and time ranges without sending the raw image to a remote server.

This provides several advantages:

- Eliminates per-request cloud API costs
- Reduces latency by removing round-trip server calls
- Improves scalability for high-volume uploads
- Strengthens privacy by keeping images on device

By leveraging local AI through NexaSDK, Happy Mapper turns what would normally be a costly cloud-dependent feature into a scalable, efficient foundation for real-time community deal discovery.
